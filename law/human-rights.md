All humans are entitled to the following rights, with no exceptions whatsoever:

1. Right to freedom of speech: All humans have the right to express their opinions, and, of course, to contribute to the government. However, to ensure safety, freedom of speech does not apply to speech intended to incite violence to encourage the violation of a legal restriction.

2. Right to physical autonomy: All humans have the right to make their own decisions about their body, and has complete ownership over their body. This includes parts of the body that are no longer in use, such as blood that was taken for medical purposes. This also includes physical information about the body.

3. Right to equality: All humans have the right to be seen as equals.

4. Right to revolution: If the government fails to meet the needs of the people it governs over, or is widely considered to be more damaging to the people than it is helpful, the government no longer serves its purpose and revolution is encouraged. However, revolution is not encouraged if the government is still useful, or if the revolution is not supported by the majority of those governed by the government.
