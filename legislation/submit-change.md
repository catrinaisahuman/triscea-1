Submitting governmental changes:

To make a change to the government, a person must submit a pull request with their requested changes. These pull requests will be publically visible but can be anonymous. Based on the voting system (https://github.com/Triscea/first-framework/blob/master/legislation/voting.rtf), the changes may then be used in the current system.

The description of the pull request should include justification for the change, and any concerns with it should be addressed in the comments of the pull request. If there is no justification for a change, unless it is a correction of some kind, it is unlikely that it will be used in the current system.
