Voting for Triseua:

People can make changes to Triseua by giving support for pull requests (for additional information on pull requests and how to submit changes to Triseua, see [add link to submit]). Although this may sound hard to measure and easy to fake, it is not. In order to both make it more fair, and to prevent interference in the vote, the value of support is related to the justification that is provided and/or the argument that is made.
The people who determine if an idea has worthwhile support are the people who contribute to the Triseua project, and make unbiased decisions to preserve the integrity of the project. More information on how these people are chosen and what they can do for Triseua is available at [add link to contributer info].

The purpose behind this method of voting is to ensure that people are aware of what they are voting for, and want the change to occur. This is intended to prevent the counting of votes that were the result of misinformation, or to prevent changes that do not have reasonable justification.
